This repostiroy contains project deliverables for Professor Jeremy Weiss' Applied Analytics Course.

The FakeNews_FinalReport.pdf contains our paper.

The ProjectProposal.pdf is our initial project proposal.

Code can be found in the Code folder. These include both python and jupyter files.
- The Joining Data and Feature Engineering describes how we constructed the dataset and created features
- The Word2VecProcessing describes another feature engineering split specifically for word embeddings.
- The Pipeline.py is where we ran all the algorithms. (Pipeline Multiconfusion is a derivative of that just for computing separate confusion matricies for each dataset)

The images folder contains the confusion matricies and ROC curves used in the final report.
